Things to improve

   * Reflection is used in everywhere... should be cached
   * Annotations should describe all mapping behavior (no Interface needed)   
   * Try Pojo seriously (verify if id is really needed)
   * Extensions: Validation (jsr330) 
   * Must have a trustable way to identify value types to automatically persist
   * Fields should can be renamed using annotations (Ex: @Property("blablabla"))
   * Serialized objects should be stored in binary fields (Ex:  @Serialized) 
   * Should be possible not use standard Javabeans
   * Fields should be indexed for better performance using annotations
   * Advanced mapper which should allow raw conversion, void toObject(DBObject) or DBObject fromObject(Object)
